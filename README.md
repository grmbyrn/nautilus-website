## Testing

Testing is an important part of this project. All testing is documented in the [Testing Guide](docs/testing.md).

The project uses:

### Unit Tests (Vitest)

- Run tests once:

```bash
npx vitest
```

- Watch mode (re-run on file changes):

```bash
npx vitest --watch
```

- Generate coverage report:

```bash
npx vitest --coverage
```

### End-to-End Tests (Playwright)

Make sure the dev server is running before running E2E tests:

```bash
npm run dev
npx playwright test
```

- Run a single test file:

```bash
npx playwright test tests/header.spec.ts
```

See the full [Testing Guide](docs/testing.md) for detailed instructions, file organization, and examples.
