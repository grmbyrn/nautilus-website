			End of last month we presented at a webinar organized by the German Chamber of Commerce in
			Spain.
		</p>

		<p>
			We were invited to collaborate during this session by the company <a
				href="https://edataconsulting.com/">edataconsulting</a
			> with whom we are working on a project.
		</p>

		<p>
			<strong>edataconsulting</strong> talked about the metaverse and we spoke about AI. The aim in this
			session was to create a good base understanding for non technical people and share some advice
			on where to start using these technologies.
		</p>
