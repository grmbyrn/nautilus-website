		<h2>Why are we attending?</h2>
		<p>
			We have several good reasons to be looking forward to be there. First is that as a company
			that is deeply committed to open-source, secure and decentralized approaches to solve
			challenges through innovative solutions, we are excited to attend the Fintech.li conference.
		</p>

		<p>
			This conference provides us with a great opportunity to learn from other like-minded
			individuals and network with them. We believe that this will be a valuable experience for our
			team as a whole, and we look forward to sharing our own experiences and expertise in these
			areas of blockchain, It-Security and learn more about web3, DAOs, and the potential
			decentralized future overall.
		</p>

		<p>
			Second, we will meet in person all the team members of our company group and have a great
			month of activities ahead of us. And last but not least we are attending two more conferences
			all related to blockchain, decentralization, etc.
		</p>

		<p>
			We will be flying in from Germany, Spain and other parts of the world to join our colleagues
			in Liechtenstein. We are all looking forward to an exciting and productive conference and time
			together! See you in no time <a href="https://blockfinance-eco.li/">BlockFinance ECO AG</a>
