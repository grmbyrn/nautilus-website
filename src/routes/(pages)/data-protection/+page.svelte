			you fully understand what we are going to do with the personal data we ask you for. In this
			way, we will be transparent and give you control of your data, with simple language and clear
			choices that will allow you to decide what we will do with your personal information.
		</p>
		<p>
			Please do not hesitate to ask us if you have any questions after reading this information.
		</p>
		<p>Thank you for your cooperation.</p>

		<h3>What will we use your data for?</h3>
		<p>
			In general, your personal data will be used to be able to relate with you and to be able to
			provide you with our software development and consulting services.
		</p>
		<p>
			It may also be used for other activities, such as sending you advertising or promoting our
			activities.
		</p>

		<h3>Why do we need to use your data?</h3>
		<p>
			Your personal data is necessary for us to be able to relate to you and provide you with our
			services, which allows us to use your information within the law.
		</p>
		<p>
			However, there are certain situations in which we will need your prior permission in order to
			carry out certain activities, such as sending you advertising or publishing your image on the
			Internet. For this purpose, we will provide you with a series of check boxes that will allow
			you to make a clear and simple decision about the use of your personal information.
		</p>

		<h3>Who will know the information we ask you for?</h3>
		<p>
			In general, only duly authorized personnel of our company will be able to know the information
			we ask you for.
		</p>
		<p>
			Similarly, those entities that need to have access to your personal information in order for
			us to provide you with our services may have access to your personal information. Thus, for
			example, our bank will know your information if the payment of our services is made by credit
			card or bank transfer.
		</p>
		<p>
			Likewise, those public or private entities to which we are obliged to provide your personal
			data in order to comply with any law will have knowledge of your information. To give you an
			example, the Tax Law requires us to provide the Tax Agency with certain information on
			economic operations that exceed a certain amount.
		</p>
		<p>
			In the event that, apart from the aforementioned cases, we need to disclose your personal
			information to other entities, we will request your prior permission through clear options
			that will allow you to decide in this regard.
		</p>

		<h3>Will we send your data to other countries?</h3>
		<p>
			In the world there are countries that are safe for your data and others that are not so safe.
			For example, the European Union is a safe environment for your data. Our policy is not to send
			your personal information to any country that is not safe from the point of view of data
			protection.
		</p>
		<p>
			In the event that, in order to provide you with the service, it is necessary to send your data
			to a country that is not as secure as Spain, we will always request your prior permission and
			we will implement effective security measures to reduce the risks of sending your personal
			information to another country.
		</p>

		<h3>How long will we keep your information?</h3>
		<p>
			We will retain your data for the duration of our relationship and as long as we are required
			to do so by law. At the end of the applicable legal periods, we will dispose of it in a secure
			and environmentally friendly manner.
		</p>

		<h3>What are your data protection rights?</h3>
		<p>
			You can contact us at any time to find out what information we hold about you, rectify it if
			it is incorrect and delete it after the end of our relationship, if this is legally possible.
		</p>
		<p>
			You also have the right to request the transfer of your information to another entity. This
			right is called “portability” and may be useful in certain situations.
		</p>
		<p>
			To request any of these rights, you must make a written request to our address, along with a
			photocopy of your ID card, so that we can identify you.
